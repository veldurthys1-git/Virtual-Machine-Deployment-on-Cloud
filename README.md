# ☁️ Virtual Machine Deployment on Cloud

This project is a web-based tool designed to simulate or manage the deployment of virtual machines (VMs) on cloud platforms. It provides an intuitive interface for selecting VM configurations, initiating deployments, and monitoring statuses, built using a modern frontend stack.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

**Frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript)**

- `src/` – Application source files:
  - `App.tsx`: Main application layout and routes.
  - `main.tsx`: Application entry point.
  - `index.css`: Tailwind global styles.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI elements like VM cards, forms, dashboards, etc.
- `index.html`: HTML entry file.
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite setup for local and production builds.
- Tailwind CSS used for modern styling.

**Backend (To Be Integrated)**

A backend service can:
- Interface with real cloud APIs (AWS EC2, Azure, GCP Compute Engine).
- Handle user authentication and VM provisioning requests.
- Track usage, billing, and logs.

## ⚙️ Installation

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd project
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to access the app.

---

## 💡 Features

- Select cloud providers and machine types.
- Input VM configuration: OS, CPU, RAM, region, storage.
- Simulate VM creation and visualize the deployment process.
- Real-time feedback and progress tracking (if backend connected).
- Responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS.

---

## 🧠 Backend/Cloud Logic (To Be Implemented)

- **Cloud API Integration**: Use SDKs like AWS SDK, Azure SDK, or Google Cloud SDK to provision resources.
- **Authentication**: Secure the platform with user login (OAuth, JWT).
- **Deployment Logs**: Track and display provisioning events.
- **Cost Estimation**: Calculate expected billing before deployment.

---

## ☁️ Deployment

Deploy this app using:

- **Vercel**
- **Netlify**
- **Render**
- **Docker + Nginx**

### Example (Vercel):

```bash
npm run build
vercel deploy
```

---

## 📦 Dependencies

The project uses:

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Connect to actual cloud platforms for live deployment.
- Add multi-VM and cluster creation support.
- Role-based access control and audit logs.
- Dashboard for managing running instances and history.
